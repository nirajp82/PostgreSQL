## 1. Introduction

In modern data-driven applications, replicating data across multiple database servers is critical for:

* High availability,
* Load balancing,
* Data distribution across geographic locations,
* Data integration,
* Disaster recovery.

PostgreSQL supports **two main replication types**:

* **Physical Replication:** Binary-level replication of data files (exact copy)
* **Logical Replication:** Row-level changes replication with fine control over what is replicated.

This guide focuses on **logical replication** — the powerful, flexible, and widely-used feature since PostgreSQL 10.

## 2. Replication in PostgreSQL: Physical vs Logical

| Feature                 | Physical Replication                    | Logical Replication                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level                   | Block-level (binary copy of data files) | Row-level (logical changes: inserts, updates, deletes)     |
| Use case                | Standby servers for failover            | Selective replication of tables, cross-version replication |
| Data copied             | Entire database cluster                 | Specific tables                                            |
| Replication direction   | One-way (primary -> standby)            | One-way, but can be configured bidirectionally             |
| Supports schema changes | No (must be identical cluster versions) | Partial support (schema changes require manual sync)       |
| Streaming               | Streaming WAL files                     | Streaming logical changes from WAL                         |

## 3. Key Concepts Explained (With Book Analogy)


| **Concept**                   | **What It Means**                                                                                                                  | **Book Analogy**                                                                            | **Example**                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WAL** (Write-Ahead Log)     | A sequential log of all changes (inserts, updates, deletes) made to the database, written *before* applying them to the main data. | The entire **book** containing every change, written line by line.                          | The book has 500 pages of changes recorded so far.                                                        |
| **LSN** (Log Sequence Number) | A unique identifier (like a position marker) that points to a specific place in the WAL. Example: “Checkpoint at LSN 12345.”       | A **line number and page number** in the book. E.g., Page 3, Line 45.                       | Your last read position is **Page 3, Line 45** (LSN 3:45).                                                |
| **Replication Slot**          | A persistent pointer to an LSN that marks where a replica should resume reading from the WAL.                                      | A **bookmark** placed at a specific line in the book, so you know where to resume reading.  | The bookmark is at Page 3, Line 45, so next time you start reading from **Line 46 on Page 3** (LSN 3:46). |
| **Publication**               | A defined set of tables on the **publisher** (source) database that should be replicated.                                          | Choosing which **chapters** (tables) from the book should be shared.                        | You decide to share only **Chapters 1 and 2** (Tables A and B) from the book.                             |
| **Subscription**              | A configuration on the **subscriber** (target) database that connects to a publication and fetches changes.                        | The **reader** who opens the book at the bookmark and starts reading the selected chapters. | You (the subscriber) connect to the publication and start reading from the bookmark at Page 3, Line 46.   |

---

### How the example ties in:

* You read the book (WAL) up to Page 3, Line 45.
* You place a bookmark there (Replication Slot) so you don’t lose your place.
* When you return, you start reading from Line 46 on Page 3 (the LSN after the bookmark).
* The publisher only shares selected chapters (Publication).
* You subscribe to those chapters (Subscription) and pull changes starting from your bookmark.
---

## 4. How Logical Replication Works Under the Hood

### 4.1 Change Capture via WAL

Every change to a table in the publisher’s database is recorded in the WAL — think of it as your master ledger. WAL logs every insert/update/delete operation *before* these changes are applied to the data files.

### 4.2 Logical Decoding

PostgreSQL uses **logical decoding** to interpret WAL changes as logical operations (e.g., "INSERT into employees table"). This process converts the WAL binary format into a logical stream understandable by subscribers.

### 4.3 Replication Slot

A **replication slot** ensures that the publisher keeps WAL files needed by the subscriber and remembers exactly where the subscriber left off. Without this, WAL files needed for replication might be removed before subscriber catches up.

### 4.4 Publication & Subscription

* **Publication** on the publisher defines the list of tables whose changes are published.
* **Subscription** on the subscriber connects to the publication and applies changes locally.

---

## 5. Setting Up Logical Replication: Step-by-step

### 5.1 Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL version 10 or higher on both publisher and subscriber.
* Network connectivity between both servers.
* PostgreSQL users with replication permissions.
* `wal_level` set to `logical` on publisher.
* Appropriate `max_replication_slots` and `max_wal_senders` values.

### 5.2 Configure Publisher

Edit `postgresql.conf`:

```conf
wal_level = logical
max_replication_slots = 10
max_wal_senders = 10
```

Update `pg_hba.conf` to allow replication connections:

```
host replication replicator 192.168.1.0/24 md5
```

Reload configs:

```sql
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

### 5.3 Create Publication

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE employees, departments;
```

### 5.4 Configure Subscriber

Create the same tables (`employees`, `departments`) with matching schemas.

Create subscription on subscriber:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
CONNECTION 'host=publisher_host port=5432 dbname=mydb user=replicator password=secret'
PUBLICATION my_publication;
```

---

## 6. Detailed Example with Commands

### Publisher Side

```sql
-- Create tables
CREATE TABLE employees (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, department_id INT);
CREATE TABLE departments (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

-- Insert initial data
INSERT INTO departments VALUES (1, 'Engineering'), (2, 'HR');
INSERT INTO employees (name, department_id) VALUES ('Alice', 1), ('Bob', 2);

-- Create publication for these tables
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE employees, departments;
```

### Subscriber Side

```sql
-- Create tables (same structure)
CREATE TABLE employees (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, department_id INT);
CREATE TABLE departments (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

-- Create subscription
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
CONNECTION 'host=publisher_host port=5432 dbname=mydb user=replicator password=secret'
PUBLICATION my_publication;
```

The subscriber will initially copy existing data and start receiving future changes.

## 7. Use Cases and Best Practices

* **Selective Replication:** Only replicate critical tables.
* **Multi-Version Replication:** Replicate between different PostgreSQL versions.
* **Data Integration:** Feed changes into reporting or analytics databases.
* **Zero Downtime Upgrades:** Use logical replication for data migration.
* **Disaster Recovery:** Have read-only replicas across locations.

---

## 8. Limitations and Caveats

* Logical replication **does not replicate schema changes** (ALTER TABLE).
* Conflicts in bidirectional replication need manual resolution.
* Does not replicate large objects (BLOBs) natively.
* Requires careful monitoring to avoid WAL file bloat.
* Initial table synchronization can be time-consuming for large datasets.

---

## 9. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Useful Views

* `pg_stat_replication`: Current replication connections.
* `pg_replication_slots`: Shows active replication slots.
* `pg_stat_subscription`: Status of subscriptions.

### Commands

```sql
-- Check replication slots and lag
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;

-- Check replication connections
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;

-- Check subscription status
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_subscription;
```

---

## 10. Performance Considerations

* Logical decoding requires CPU for decoding WAL.
* Network bandwidth must be adequate.
* Replication slots may retain WAL files, so monitor disk space.
* Tune `wal_sender_timeout`, `wal_receiver_status_interval`.
* Consider batch size and apply delays for load control.

---

## 11. Advanced Real-World Scenarios

* **Bidirectional replication:** Two nodes act as both publishers and subscribers.
* **Filtered replication:** Using row filters (coming in later PostgreSQL versions).
* **Cross-database replication:** Replicate between different databases.
* **Replicating sequences and indexes:** Requires manual sync.

---

## 12. Summary

Logical replication is a powerful, flexible tool in PostgreSQL to replicate selective tables’ changes at the logical level with full control and granularity. Understanding WAL, LSN, replication slots, publications, and subscriptions — and their interaction — is key to setting up, monitoring, and troubleshooting logical replication systems.

# Appendix: Book Analogy Recap

* WAL = **The book** — complete record of all changes
* LSN = **Page & line number** — where you are in the book
* Replication Slot = **Bookmark** — marks the last read position in the book
* Publication = **Chapters shared** — tables selected for replication
* Subscription = **Reader** — connects and reads from bookmark onward
