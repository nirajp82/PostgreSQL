- **Shared Buffers:**

  - **What it is:**  
    `shared_buffers` is a portion of RAM that PostgreSQL uses to cache frequently accessed data. Think of it as a staging area for data retrieved from disk.

  - **How it helps:**  
    When `VACUUM` needs to scan a heap block (a page of data from a table), it first checks if that block is already in `shared_buffers`. If it is (a "cache hit"), `VACUUM` can access the data directly from memory, which is *much* faster than reading it from disk (a "cache miss").

  - **Increasing `shared_buffers`:**  
    By increasing the size of `shared_buffers`, you increase the likelihood that the heap blocks `VACUUM` needs will already be in memory. This reduces the number of expensive disk I/O operations, making the heap scan phase of `VACUUM` significantly faster.

- **pg_prewarm:**

  - **What it is:**  
    `pg_prewarm` is a PostgreSQL extension that allows you to manually load tables and indexes into `shared_buffers`.

  - **How it helps:**  
    `VACUUM` often needs to scan entire tables. With `pg_prewarm`, you can proactively load these tables (or at least the most frequently accessed parts) into `shared_buffers` *before* `VACUUM` starts. This ensures that when `VACUUM` begins its heap scan, the data it needs is already in memory, resulting in a very fast scan.


###- **What is a Heap Block?**
  - PostgreSQL stores table data on disk in files. These files are divided into fixed-size pages, and these pages are what we call heap blocks._ A heap block is a 8KB chunk of data stored on disk that contains a set of table rows (tuples). Each table in PostgreSQL is stored in a series of these blocks. 
  - PostgreSQL organizes the data in a heap structure, where rows are stored in no specific order within these blocks. As a result, the heap block is where the table's actual data resides, along with metadata such as row visibility information.

- **How It Works:**
  - During a `VACUUM` operation, PostgreSQL scans these heap blocks to identify and remove **dead tuples** (rows that are no longer needed). Each time PostgreSQL needs to access a row, it checks the heap blocks to find the corresponding data.
  - If the data isn't already cached in memory, the block must be read from disk, which can be a slow process. This is why reducing disk I/O by caching heap blocks in memory (via `shared_buffers`) or preloading them (via `pg_prewarm`) can significantly speed up operations like `VACUUM`.

- **Heap Block and `VACUUM` Performance:**
  - When `VACUUM` scans a heap block, it examines all the rows within it. If a block is in memory (a cache hit), PostgreSQL can quickly process it. But if the block is on disk (a cache miss), it takes longer to read the data.
  - The larger the table, the more heap blocks need to be processed. Optimizing how these blocks are managed in memory is critical for improving the speed of operations like `VACUUM`, which often needs to scan all of a table's heap blocks to clean up dead tuples.
