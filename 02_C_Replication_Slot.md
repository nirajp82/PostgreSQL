# **Replication Slots: Ensuring Reliable Replication**

Replication slots in PostgreSQL are a critical feature for ensuring **reliable replication** from the primary server to its standby servers. They ensure that WAL (Write-Ahead Log) records are retained until all connected standby servers have received and acknowledged them. This mechanism prevents data loss, even in cases where a standby server is temporarily offline or lagging behind the primary server.

Each standby server is associated with a dedicated replication slot on the primary server. These slots track the progress of replication for each specific standby, ensuring that the primary does not discard WAL segments that are still needed by the replica. This guide explains how replication slots work, how to configure them, and how to monitor their status to ensure reliable replication.

## **What is a Replication Slot?**

A **replication slot** is a persistent object on the primary server that tracks the state of replication for each connected standby. The primary server ensures that WAL logs are retained until the slot indicates that they are no longer required by the associated standby. Replication slots are critical for preventing the primary server from discarding WAL logs that are still needed for replication.

A single replication slot cannot be shared simultaneously by multiple standby databases (or replication clients). In PostgreSQL, a replication slot is tied to a specific replication connection (whether physical or logical). Each replication client (publisher or subscriber) needs its own replication slot to track its progress through the WAL stream.

### **Slot Types**:

1. **Physical Replication Slot**: Used for streaming the entire database.
2. **Logical Replication Slot**: Used for more granular replication, typically on specific tables or databases.

## **Step-by-Step Guide: Managing Replication Slots**

### **1. Creating a Replication Slot**

To set up replication, you first need to create a replication slot. You can create a **physical replication slot** or a **logical replication slot**, depending on your replication type.

#### **Creating a Physical Replication Slot**:

This slot type is used for streaming the entire database (commonly used in hot standby configurations).

```sql
SELECT pg_create_physical_replication_slot('replica_slot_name');
```

#### **Creating a Logical Replication Slot**:

Logical replication allows you to replicate specific tables or data changes. You must specify an output plugin (e.g., `test_decoding` for basic logical replication).

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('logical_slot_name', 'test_decoding');
```

**Columns in `pg_replication_slots`:**

* `slot_name`: Name of the replication slot.
* `slot_type`: Type of replication slot (`physical` or `logical`).

---

### **2. Assigning the Replication Slot to the Standby Server**

To ensure that a standby server uses a specific replication slot, you need to configure the **standby server** to connect to the primary server and specify the replication slot during the connection setup. This is typically done using the `pg_basebackup` tool or by specifying the replication connection settings in `recovery.conf` (or `standby.signal` in newer versions).

#### **Example of Specifying a Replication Slot in `recovery.conf`**:

For PostgreSQL versions prior to 12, use the `recovery.conf` file to specify the replication slot for a standby server. From PostgreSQL 12 onwards, this is handled through the `standby.signal` file and `postgresql.conf`.

* **In `recovery.conf` (PostgreSQL < 12)**:

  ```ini
  standby_mode = 'on'
  primary_conninfo = 'host=primary_server port=5432 user=replication_user password=replication_password'
  primary_slot_name = 'replica_slot_name'  -- Specify the replication slot name
  ```
* **In `postgresql.conf` (PostgreSQL >= 12)**:

  ```ini
  primary_conninfo = 'host=primary_server port=5432 user=replication_user password=replication_password'
  primary_slot_name = 'replica_slot_name'  -- Specify the replication slot name
  ```
* **In `standby.signal` (PostgreSQL >= 12)**: Ensure this file exists on the standby, and the slot name is referenced in the configuration.

#### **Monitoring Replication Slots on the Standby Server**:

Once a standby server is configured to use a replication slot, you can monitor the status of replication slots using the `pg_replication_slots` system view.

##### Command to Check Replication Slot Status:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

**Key Columns in `pg_replication_slots`:**

* `slot_name`: The unique name of the replication slot.
* `active`: Indicates whether the replication slot is currently active (i.e., whether data is being streamed to a replica).
* `active_pid`: The process ID of the session streaming data for the slot (null if inactive).
* `confirmed_flush_lsn`: The address of the last WAL record confirmed by the replication slot consumer (for logical slots).
* `wal_status`: The current availability of WAL files for the slot (e.g., `reserved`, `extended`, `unreserved`, `lost`).

---

### **3. Dropping a Replication Slot**

When a replication slot is no longer needed (e.g., if the associated standby server is permanently down), you should drop the slot to free up resources and avoid disk space issues on the primary server.

#### **Command to Drop a Replication Slot**:

```sql
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('replica_slot_name');
```

**Important Considerations**:

* Before dropping a replication slot, ensure that it is no longer in use by any active standbys (check the `active` column in `pg_replication_slots`).
* If the slot is still active or if there are issues with the replica (such as being behind in WAL consumption), dropping the slot could lead to data loss or inconsistent replication.

---

### **4. Monitoring and Managing Replication Slot Health**

To ensure that your replication slots are functioning correctly, you need to monitor their status regularly. The `pg_replication_slots` view provides important diagnostic information:

#### **Key Columns to Monitor**:

* **`active`**: This column indicates whether the slot is actively being used for replication. If `false`, it may indicate that the replica is disconnected or lagging behind.

* **`wal_status`**: Tracks the status of the WAL files associated with the slot:

  * `reserved`: The WAL files required by this slot are still within the `max_wal_size`.
  * `extended`: WAL files exceed `max_wal_size`, but they are still being retained by the slot.
  * `unreserved`: The WAL files are no longer needed and will be removed at the next checkpoint.
  * `lost`: The slot is no longer usable, often due to missing required WAL files.

* **`confirmed_flush_lsn`**: For logical replication slots, this column tells you up to which point the consumer has successfully received data. If this value is lagging behind the current WAL, you may have replication delays.

* **`invalidation_reason`**: If a replication slot becomes invalid (for logical slots), this column will provide the reason. Possible reasons include:

  * `wal_removed`: Required WAL files were removed.
  * `rows_removed`: Required rows for logical replication were vacuumed or deleted.
  * `wal_level_insufficient`: The `wal_level` was too low for logical replication.
  * `idle_timeout`: The slot has remained inactive longer than the configured timeout.

##### Command to Monitor Slot Activity:

```sql
SELECT slot_name, active, wal_status, confirmed_flush_lsn, invalidation_reason 
FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

---

### **5. Handling Slot Conflicts**

Replication slots, especially logical ones, can sometimes become invalid due to conflicts, such as when required WAL files are deleted or when the `wal_level` is insufficient.

* If a slot becomes invalid, the `conflicting` column will be set to `true` for logical replication slots.
* You can query the `pg_replication_slots` view to check if any slots have encountered conflicts:

#### **Command to Check for Conflicting Slots**:

```sql
SELECT slot_name, conflicting, invalidation_reason
FROM pg_replication_slots
WHERE conflicting = true;
```

---

### **6. Configuring Replication Slot for Prepared Transactions (Logical Slots)**

For logical replication slots, you can configure them to support **two-phase commit** for prepared transactions. This is done by enabling the `two_phase` setting when creating the slot.

#### **Command to Create a Logical Slot with Two-Phase Commit**:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('logical_slot_name', 'test_decoding', true);
```

**Columns in `pg_replication_slots`:**

* `two_phase`: Indicates if two-phase commit is enabled for the logical slot.
* `two_phase_at`: The LSN (Log Sequence Number) at which two-phase commit is enabled.

---
### How Do Replication Slots Impact the System?

1. **Resource Consumption**:

   * **Memory**: Each replication slot consumes some amount of memory, particularly for logical replication, which tracks row-level changes. The more slots you create, the more memory PostgreSQL uses to track the replication state for each slot.
   * **File Descriptors**: Each slot may require an active connection to the database, which consumes file descriptors. On systems with limited file descriptors, this could lead to issues.

2. **Impact on Performance**:

   * **Overhead**: The more replication slots you have, the more overhead there will be, particularly if many slots are active at the same time. High numbers of replication slots can lead to increased memory usage and file descriptor consumption, potentially affecting the database’s overall performance.
   * **Lag Monitoring**: Replication slots can also help you monitor lag by tracking the time since the last message was received from the publisher. If a slot hasn’t received data in a while, it indicates potential replication issues.

3. **Potential for Stale Data**:

   * If a replication slot is not used for a long time (e.g., the subscriber has disconnected), PostgreSQL will continue to retain WAL data for that slot, which could eventually fill up disk space if there is no active replication. This could lead to storage issues if not managed properly.

4. **Limits and Configurations**:

   * PostgreSQL allows you to configure the maximum number of replication slots using the `max_replication_slots` parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file. While there is no strict "hard" limit, system resources like memory and file descriptors will effectively limit the number of slots you can use.
   * If you exceed available resources or have too many inactive replication slots, it can lead to degraded performance.

---
### **Replication Slot Lifecycle and Best Practices**

* **Fault Tolerance**: Replication slots ensure that WAL segments required by a standby are not discarded by the primary server, even if the standby goes offline temporarily.
* **Data Consistency**: Replication slots ensure that data is not lost when a standby server reconnects after a disconnect or crash.
* **Storage Considerations**: Keep track of slot status (using `pg_replication_slots`) to ensure that WAL files are not unnecessarily retained. Use `max_slot_wal_keep_size` to manage retention and prevent disk issues.

## **Final Thoughts:**

Replication slots are vital for ensuring **consistent and reliable replication** between the primary and standby servers in PostgreSQL. By creating, monitoring, and managing these slots correctly, you can prevent data loss, handle replication conflicts, and ensure seamless failover scenarios. Regular monitoring of the


`pg_replication_slots` view will help maintain healthy replication across all servers.
